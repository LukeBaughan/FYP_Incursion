# Incursion

A mix of the tower defence genre and the first-person shooter genre where the player must defend against waves of alien enemies
in order to survive. They can achieve this by purchasing towers to attack autonomously in addition to shooting the enemies themselves.
Incursion was made entirely using the blueprint system in Unreal Engine 5 (and uses marketplace content for assets).
